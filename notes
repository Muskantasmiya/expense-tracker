This project is an Expense Tracker app that allows users to input their expenses (amount, description, and category) and displays them in a list. The app uses HTML for structure, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality such as adding, editing, and deleting expenses.

Here's a line-by-line explanation of the JavaScript file (script.js) used in the Expense Tracker app:

let expenses = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("expenses")) || [];: Retrieves the existing expenses from local storage or initializes an empty array if no expenses are stored.

function renderExpenses() { ... }: Defines a function to render the list of expenses on the page.

expenses.forEach((expense, index) => { ... });: Iterates over each expense in the expenses array and creates a row in the expense list for each expense.

deleteButton.addEventListener("click", function () { ... });: Adds a click event listener to the delete button to delete the expense when clicked.

editButton.addEventListener("click", function () { ... });: Adds a click event listener to the edit button to edit the expense when clicked.

document.getElementById("addExpense").addEventListener("click", function () { ... });: Adds a click event listener to the "Add Expense" button to add a new expense.

function deleteExpense(index) { ... }: Defines a function to delete an expense from the expenses array and update the UI.

function editExpense(index) { ... }: Defines a function to edit an expense by populating the input fields with the expense details and then deleting the expense.

function updateTotalExpenses() { ... }: Defines a function to update the total expenses displayed at the bottom of the page.

renderExpenses();: Renders the initial list of expenses when the page is loaded.

updateTotalExpenses();: Updates the total expenses when the page is loaded.

This JavaScript file provides the functionality to add, edit, and delete expenses, as well as render the list of expenses and update the total expenses displayed on the page.
